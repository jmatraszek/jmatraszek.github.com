  <h1>VLAN configuration on OPNsense router, dd-wrt access points and TP-Link switches</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I had a hard time getting my VLAN configuration to work, so I thought I’ll write down the process — maybe someone will find it useful.</p>
<p>My network configuration looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/network_diagram.png" alt="Network diagram" /></p>
<p>I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A router (<code>router</code>) running OPNsense on PCengines hardware;</li>
<li>Two access points (<code>ap1</code> and <code>ap2</code>) running dd-wrt on TP-Link WDR4300;</li>
<li>Two TP-Link Smart Easy switches (<code>switch1</code> and <code>switch2</code>) on TL-SE108E and TL-SE105E.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three new Wi-Fi networks (one for guests, one for IoT devices, one for my own experiments);</li>
<li>Port number 3 on ap1, ap2 and switch2 assigned to my own network exclusively;</li>
<li>Ports number 1 and 2 pass VLAN tags all the way to the router, so the VLANs are visible to the OPNsense system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Router configuration</h2>
<p>I started by configuring VLAN interfaces in OPNsense under
<code>Interfaces &gt; Other types &gt; VLAN</code> tab. I chose tag <code>3</code> for my private network, <code>7</code> for guest network and <code>9</code> for IoT network. All VLANs were created on a LAN interface (<code>igb1</code> in my case).</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/router_vlan_tags.png" alt="VLAN tags" /></p>
<p>Next, under <code>Interfaces &gt; Assignments</code> I created new interfaces.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/router_vlan_interfaces.png" alt="VLAN interfaces" /></p>
<p>Configuration of the newly-created interfaces is described really well in OPNsense’s docs, so I am not going to repeat them (in my case I did skip configuring captive portal, vouchers and bandwidth limit — all I needed was to configure DHCP and firewall rules). You can find the guide <a href="https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/guestnet.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Switches configuration</h2>
<p>Next, I configured VLANs in <code>switch1</code>. Port based VLAN has to be disabled and 802.1Q VLAN has to be enabled. As <code>router</code> is connected to the first port in <code>switch1</code> and <code>ap1</code> is connected to the second port, I had to put ports <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> into all my VLANs as tagged ports. The rest of the ports are part of the default VLAN as untagged port. No device will be connected to any VLAN directly through <code>switch1</code>, we just need to pass VLAN packets between <code>router</code> and <code>ap1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/switch1_vlans.png" alt="switch1 VLANs" /></p>
<p>Next, I configured <code>switch2</code>. This is the last device in my wired network, so the configuration for it varies a little from that of <code>switch1</code>. I just want to connect a single device to VLAN 3 using port 3, so <code>switch2</code> does not need to have VLANs 7 and 9 configured — it does not pass any packets for these VLANs. So I created a single VLAN, with tagged ports 3 (to connect the device) and 1 (to pass down the packets all the way to the router through all other network devices).</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/switch2_vlans.png" alt="switch2 VLANs" /></p>
<p>Because I want the device connected to port 3 to be available directly in VLAN 3, I had to configure port 3 to be in that VLAN by default. To do that, I set PVID for that port to the ID of the VLAN (3).</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/switch2_pvid.png" alt="switch2 PVID" /></p>
<p>This didn’t allow me to test if my configuration was correct at that point, as I could not put any device into any of my VLANs by plugging it to <code>router</code> or <code>switch1</code>. I could only do that by using port 3 in <code>switch2</code>, but I hadn’t configured VLANs yet on <code>ap1</code> and <code>ap2</code> and they were in between.</p>
<h2>Access points configuration</h2>
<p>The dd-wrt configuration was the most complicated for me. Two things that I learned the hard way:</p>
<ul>
<li>TP-Link WDR4300 is an Atheros based router — it does not support configuring VLANs through <code>nvram</code> command, you have to use <code>swconfig</code>;</li>
<li>Swconfig settings are not saved in nvram, so you have to run the <code>swconfig</code> configuration with each boot;</li>
<li>There are a couple of naming schemes for VLAN devices, this is configured through <code>vconfig</code> command, you can see your current configuration by using <code>cat /proc/net/vlan/config</code> — tutorials use different schemes, so in your case it may be <code>vlan3</code> instead of <code>eth0.3</code> — just check your current configuration and adapt the tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main idea is quite simple: I created a new virtual WiFi interface working in Layer 2 (no IP address assigned to that interface), a new VLAN interface also working in Layer 2 with proper ports assigned to that VLAN and a bridge interface that bridged those two interfaces together, working in Layer 3 (IP address assigned to bridge interface).</p>
<p>First, I set up a new virtual interface under <code>Wireless &gt; Basic Settings</code>. I made it unbridged. This created a new interface called <code>ath0.1</code> with the following settings.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_wifi.png" alt="Access point WiFi" /></p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to set up Wireless Security for you new WiFi network.</li>
<li>If you want to use the second band WiFi, just set up a new virtual interface for it and just remember to assign it to a bridge later. I didn’t need it, so I just created a single virtual interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, under <code>Setup &gt; Networking</code> I set up VLAN tagging. I created VLAN tags on <code>eth0</code> interface.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_vlan_tagging.png" alt="Access point VLAN tagging" /></p>
<p>This created new interfaces with names that matched the <code>vconfig</code> scheme, so in my case it was <code>eth0.3</code> for VLAN 3.</p>
<p>Then I configured the VLANs on the internal switch. This was the hardest part to get right. You can find the detailed description and a really helpful diagram in dd-wrt wiki <a href="https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/TP-Link_TL-WDR4300">here</a>.</p>
<p>The switch has three physical interfaces — <code>ath0</code> for 2.4GHz WiFi, <code>ath1</code> for 5GHz WiFi, <code>eth0</code> for physical connections and configuring the internal switch, all working in Layer 2, and three logical interfaces — <code>vlan0</code> that represents LAN, <code>vlan1</code> that represents WAN and <code>br0</code> that represents whole LAN network and works in Layer 3 (it has an IP address). Normally, <code>vlan1</code> also has an IP address of WAN, but in my case the dd-wrt works only as an access point, so there is no WAN, and <code>vlan1</code> is assigned to <code>br0</code> to get an extra LAN port.</p>
<p>It’s also important to get the port numbering right. WAN port has number 1, LAN ports have numbers 2 to 5, port 0 is the port that is physically connected to <code>eth0</code> interface. Ports 0 and 2 to 5 are put to <code>vlan0</code>, ports 0 and 1 are put to <code>vlan1</code>.</p>
<p>I had to enable VLAN 3 on <code>eth0</code> interface and assign ports to VLAN — just remember to mark the ports as tagged (ports 1 and 2 — or 2 and 3 when using the internal numbering scheme) or untagged (port 3 — or 4, by internal numbering scheme).</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"># Setup VLAN 3
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 set enable_vlan 3
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 vlan 3 set ports &quot;0t 2t 3t 4&quot;
</span></pre>
<p>For VLANs 7 and 9 I did not need a physical port, so I just set up tagged ports (note the lack of “4” at the end)</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"># Setup VLAN 7
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 set enable_vlan 7
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 vlan 7 set ports &quot;0t 2t 3t&quot;
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"># Setup VLAN 9
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 set enable_vlan 9
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 vlan 9 set ports &quot;0t 2t 3t&quot;
</span></pre>
<p>Then I just needed to apply the configuration</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;">
<span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"># Apply
</span><span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">swconfig dev eth0 set apply
</span></pre>
<p>This is not persisted in nvram, so I entered those commands in <code>Administration &gt; Commands</code> and saved them as startup.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_commands.png" alt="Access point commands" /></p>
<p>Then I had to configure bridges — the logical interfaces that would bridge together VLAN interface with WiFi virtual interface, and that would work in Layer 3 (with IP address assigned).</p>
<p>First, under <code>Setup &gt; Networking</code>, I created three bridges, each for a single VLAN I was configuring.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_bridges.png" alt="Access point bridges" /></p>
<p>Then, I configured bridge assignments. For example, VLAN 3 is represented by bridge <code>br1</code>. I had to assign <code>ath0.1</code> (WiFi virtual) and <code>eth0.3</code> (VLAN) interfaces.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_bridge_assignments.png" alt="Access point bridge assignments" /></p>
<p>The full bridging table looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_bridging_table.png" alt="Access point bridging table" /></p>
<p>The last thing was to assign IP addresses to the bridges.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vlans/ap1_bridges_ips.png" alt="Access point bridges IPs" /></p>
<p>This was the last thing left to configure. I have all VLANs working now, just as I designed — I can connect to VLAN WiFi network or to a third port on <code>ap1</code>, <code>ap2</code> or <code>switch2</code> (only for VLAN 3).</p>
<p>And just a final word — I am no expert when it comes to networking, so if you find any errors, bad wording etc. — just email me and I’ll be more than happy to correct my mistakes.</p>
